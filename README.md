**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
  
The Gaming Room wanted help integrating their mobile app Draw It or Lose It for the web. They wanted to know how best to design and host this for the best security and performance.
  
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

In this documentation, I am particularly proud of the recommendations as at this point the material all began to click for me, and I was confident that what I was writing was correct.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

I have programmed clients and servers before at my previous university, however learning about how they work made me better understand why we design them the way that we do. That was something that had not been explained to me until this course.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could revise anything it would be the executive summary as at that point I knew the least and now I could write something more descriptive for it.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user’s needs by understanding what is necessary for the application to run smoothly, be well functioning, and be accessible to the users. It is important to consider the user’s needs because ultimately, it needs to run in a way that makes them want to use the application. If the user rejects the application, then it is not completing its purpose.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

The way I approached designing software was to map out what was needed in a UML diagram, then declare the variables and make shells for the methods (adding TODO comments), then go back in and figure out functionality, testing it along the way. In the future, I will definitely continue to use UML diagrams, although my process otherwise may change if I find a better one.
