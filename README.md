# AcademicProjects

Description:
This project shows which grocery items were purchased and in what quantities in varying ways.
What it solved:
The purpose of it was to make it easier for the staff at the store to view the number of items bought for each item.
What I did well:
What I believe I did particularly well was that I used the map object efficiently.
What could be improved:
The biggest improvement I could think of at this point is to sanitize user data. Right now the user has the ability to crash the program and cause it to need to be restarted if they put in invalid data.
Biggest challenge:
The biggest issue I faced was attempting to use and understand maps (in Java I had used dictionaries which are functionally the same, but I did not know that at the time). I went to the C++ documentation site for help with explanations and will continue to do so in the future.
What skills are transferable:
In complete transparency, I did not have much experience in Visual Studio prior to this class. For many places, it is an industry standard and so I would say this is my most transferable skill.
How was the program made maintainable, adaptable, and readable:
Aside from documenting my code and other basic actions when it comes to designing code, I also made the file a variable in main which the file opening function takes as a parameter. This allows for an easy switch if another grocery item list needed to be swapped out.



**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
  
The Gaming Room wanted help integrating their mobile app Draw It or Lose It for the web. They wanted to know how best to design and host this for the best security and performance.
  
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

In this documentation, I am particularly proud of the recommendations as at this point the material all began to click for me, and I was confident that what I was writing was correct.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

I have programmed clients and servers before at my previous university, however learning about how they work made me better understand why we design them the way that we do. That was something that had not been explained to me until this course.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I could revise anything it would be the executive summary as at that point I knew the least and now I could write something more descriptive for it.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user’s needs by understanding what is necessary for the application to run smoothly, be well functioning, and be accessible to the users. It is important to consider the user’s needs because ultimately, it needs to run in a way that makes them want to use the application. If the user rejects the application, then it is not completing its purpose.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

The way I approached designing software was to map out what was needed in a UML diagram, then declare the variables and make shells for the methods (adding TODO comments), then go back in and figure out functionality, testing it along the way. In the future, I will definitely continue to use UML diagrams, although my process otherwise may change if I find a better one.
