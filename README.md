# AcademicProjects

Description:
This project shows which grocery items were purchased and in what quantities in varying ways.
What it solved:
The purpose of it was to make it easier for the staff at the store to view the number of items bought for each item.
What I did well:
What I believe I did particularly well was that I used the map object efficiently.
What could be improved:
The biggest improvement I could think of at this point is to sanitize user data. Right now the user has the ability to crash the program and cause it to need to be restarted if they put in invalid data.
Biggest challenge:
The biggest issue I faced was attempting to use and understand maps (in Java I had used dictionaries which are functionally the same, but I did not know that at the time). I went to the C++ documentation site for help with explanations and will continue to do so in the future.
What skills are transferable:
In complete transparency, I did not have much experience in Visual Studio prior to this class. For many places, it is an industry standard and so I would say this is my most transferable skill.
How was the program made maintainable, adaptable, and readable:
Aside from documenting my code and other basic actions when it comes to designing code, I also made the file a variable in main which the file opening function takes as a parameter. This allows for an easy switch if another grocery item list needed to be swapped out.
